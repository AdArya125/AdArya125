I am a Computer Science graduate student at IIT Delhi (M.Tech, CSE) with a strong academic and practical foundation in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and core computer science. My work emphasizes rigorous problem formulation, sound algorithmic design, and well-structured implementations. I am currently focused on low-level systems concepts and am actively working on systems-oriented projects.

I have experience developing machine learning models, AI-driven systems, and data-intensive pipelines using Python, with an emphasis on correctness, reproducibility, and scalability. I am particularly interested in applying ML and AI techniques to complex, constraint-driven, and systems-centric problems.
